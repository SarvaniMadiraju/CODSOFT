I - CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION(Task-2)

Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection

Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset 
containing information about credit card transactions, 
and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,
or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

II - SPAM SMS DETECTION(Task-4)

Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset

Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. 
Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like 
Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages

III - CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION(Task-3)

Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction

Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-
based service or business. Use historical customer data, including
features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try
algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient
Boosting to predict churn.
